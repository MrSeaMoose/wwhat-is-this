use state is the way react stores malleable data

const addBubble = () => {
    if (inputText.trim() !== '') {
      setBubbles([...bubbles, inputText]);
      setInputText(''); // Clear input after adding
     }

okay so this is a constant which means it itself cannot be changed


const [bubbles, setBubbles] = useState([]);
in this, the data it represents can be changed, therefore you cannot reassign bubbles,
but you CAN do something like, bubbles.push("bubow")
In this, bubbles is the value, and can only be manipulated by using setBubbles;
so, you would do setBubbles(5), which would modify bubbles\

setBubbles([...bubbles, inputText]);
the spread operator = . . ., it allows for us to output/input values from an array individually
so, const myList = [bubbles, bananas]
console.log(...myList) == "bubbles", "bananas"
- just using bubbles.push doesn't create a new array, and so react is blind
so, by doing ...bubbles, we create that new arrray

style={{
              padding: '10px 20px', //vertical & horz padding
              backgroundColor: '#3e1af2ff', //self explanatory
              color: 'white',
              borderRadius: '20px',
              fontSize: '16px'
            }}


meta <name = desc content = self explanatory \>
<link rel="icon" href="/favicon.ico" /> 
- so in public, put the desired web img, then change the one ref here
